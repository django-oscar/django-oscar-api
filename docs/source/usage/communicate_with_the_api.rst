=============
Example Usage
=============
When you browse through the API (see also the :ref:`django-oscar-sandbox` section), most of the things are already pretty clear in terms how you can communicate with the API. In the following examples we use the python `requests`_ package to demonstate how the API works.

.. _`requests`: http://docs.python-requests.org/


Get the basket
--------------
First get our basket and see the response:

.. code-block:: python

    import requests

    # this will persist the session cookies automatically for us
    session = requests.Session()

    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/basket/')
    print(response.content)
    {
        "currency": null,
        "id": 1,
        "is_tax_known": true,
        "lines": "http://localhost:8000/api/baskets/1/lines/",
        "offer_discounts": [],
        "owner": null,
        "status": "Open",
        "total_excl_tax": "0.00",
        "total_excl_tax_excl_discounts": "0.00",
        "total_incl_tax": "0.00",
        "total_incl_tax_excl_discounts": "0.00",
        "total_tax": "0.00",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/baskets/1/",
        "voucher_discounts": []
    }

.. note::
    We need to re-send the cookies (wich include the `django session id`) to make sure we get the same basket again, this is the reason we use ``requests.Session()``. Otherwise we would get a new basket each request. So it's important to keep a track of sessions in your application. You can also use an alternative session middleware like the :ref:`header-session-label`.

.. code-block:: python

    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/basket/')
    # we get the same basket when we send the session cookie
    print(response.json()['id'])
    1

To see what's inside the basket we need to get the basket lines:

.. code-block:: python

    lines_url = response.json()['lines']
    response = session.get(lines_url)
    # we don't have any lines yet because we did not put anything in the basket
    print(response.content)
    []


Add products to the basket
--------------------------
To add a product to the basket we first need to get the available products:

.. code-block:: python

    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/products/')
    print(response.content)
    [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/2/"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Oscar T-shirt",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/1/"
        }
    ]

You can fetch the detail of each product by following it's url:

.. code-block:: python

    products = response.json()
    # get the details of the second product
    response = session.get(products[1]['url'])
    print(response.content)
    {
        "attributes": [
            {
                "name": "Size",
                "value": "Small"
            }
        ],
        "availability": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/1/availability/",
        "categories": [
            "Clothing"
        ],
        "date_created": "2013-12-12T16:33:57.426000Z",
        "date_updated": "2013-12-12T16:33:57.426000Z",
        "description": "",
        "id": 1,
        "images": [],
        "options": [],
        "price": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/1/price/",
        "product_class": "T-shirt",
        "recommended_products": [],
        "stockrecords": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/1/stockrecords/",
        "title": "Oscar T-shirt",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/1/"
    }

Ok, now we want to add this to our basket:

.. code-block:: python

    data = {
        "url": products[1]['url'],
        "quantity": 1
    }

    response = session.post('http://localhost:8000/api/basket/add-product/', json=data)

And we can see that it has been added:

.. code-block:: python

    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/basket/')
    lines_url = response.json()['lines']
    response = session.get(lines_url)
    print(response.content)
    [
        {
            "attributes": [],
            "basket": "http://localhost:8000/api/baskets/1/",
            "date_created": "2015-12-30T17:05:05.041698Z",
            "is_tax_known": true,
            "price_currency": "EUR",
            "price_excl_tax": "10.00",
            "price_excl_tax_excl_discounts": "10.00",
            "price_incl_tax": "10.00",
            "price_incl_tax_excl_discounts": "10.00",
            "product": "http://localhost:8000/api/products/1/",
            "quantity": 1,
            "stockrecord": "http://localhost:8000/api/stockrecords/1/",
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/lines/1/",
            "warning": null
        }
    ]


Place an order (checkout)
-------------------------

When your basket is filled an you want to proceed to checkout you can do a single call with all information needed. Note that we are doing an anonymous checkout here, so we need to set the `guest_email` field. (Make sure that ``OSCAR_ALLOW_ANON_CHECKOUT`` is set to ``True`` in your ``settings.py``). If you don't support anonymous checkouts you will have to login the user first (see login example below).

.. code-block:: python

    guest_email = "foo@example.com"

    # get our basket information
    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/basket/')
    basket_data = response.json()

    # oscar needs a country for the shipping address. You can get a list of
    # the available countries with the api
    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/countries/')
    countries = response.json()
    print(countries)
    [
        {
            "display_order": 0,
            "is_shipping_country": true,
            "iso_3166_1_a3": "NLD",
            "iso_3166_1_numeric": "528",
            "name": "Kingdom of the Netherlands",
            "printable_name": "Netherlands",
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/countries/NL/"
        }
    ]    

    # we need the country url in the shipping address
    country_url = countries[0]['url']

    # let's fill out the request data
    data = {
        "basket": basket_data['url'],
        "guest_email": guest_email,
        "total": basket_data['total_incl_tax'],
        "shipping_method_code": "no-shipping-required",
        # the shipping charge is optional, but we leave it here for example purposes
        "shipping_charge": {
            "currency": basket_data['currency'],
            "excl_tax": "0.0",
            "tax": "0.0"
        },
        "shipping_address": {
            "country": country_url,
            "first_name": "Henk",
            "last_name": "Van den Heuvel",
            "line1": "Roemerlaan 44",
            "line2": "",
            "line3": "",
            "line4": "Kroekingen",
            "notes": "",
            "phone_number": "+31 26 370 4887",
            "postcode": "7777KK",
            "state": "Gerendrecht",
            "title": "Mr"
        }
    }

    # now we can place the order
    response = session.post('http://localhost:8000/api/checkout/', json=data)

    # and the api should give us a response with all info needed
    print (response.content)
    {
        "basket": "http://localhost:8000/api/baskets/1/",
        "billing_address": null,
        "currency": "EUR",
        "date_placed": "2016-01-02T23:18:01.089796Z",
        "guest_email": "foo@example.com",
        "lines": "http://localhost:8000/api/orders/1/lines/",
        # this is the order number generated in oscar
        "number": "10001",
        "offer_discounts": [],
        "owner": null,
        # the payment view is something you will have to implement yourself, 
        # see the note below
        "payment_url": "You need to implement a view named 'api-payment' which redirects to the payment provider and sets up the callbacks.",
        "shipping_address": {
            "country": "http://localhost:8000/api/countries/NL/",
            "first_name": "Henk",
            "id": 3,
            "last_name": "Van den Heuvel",
            "line1": "Roemerlaan 44",
            "line2": "",
            "line3": "",
            "line4": "Kroekingen",
            "notes": "",
            "phone_number": "+31 26 370 4887",
            "postcode": "7777KK",
            "search_text": "Henk Van den Heuvel Roemerlaan 44 Kroekingen Gerendrecht 7777KK Kingdom of the Netherlands",
            "state": "Gerendrecht",
            "title": "Mr"
        },
        "shipping_code": "free-shipping",
        "shipping_excl_tax": "0.00",
        "shipping_incl_tax": "0.00",
        "shipping_method": "Free shipping",
        "status": "new",
        "total_excl_tax": "10.00",
        "total_incl_tax": "10.00",
        # you can fetch the order details by getting this url
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/orders/1/",
        "voucher_discounts": []
    }    

.. note::
    After you placed an order with the api, the basket is frozen. Oscar API has checks for this in the checkout view and won't let you checkout the same (or any frozen) basket again. At this stage an order is submitted in Oscar and you will have to implement the following steps regarding payment yourself. See the ``payment_url`` field above in the response. You can also use the regular Oscar checkout views if you like, take a look at the :ref:`mixed-usage-label` section.

.. _login-user-label:

Login the user
--------------
When you don't support anonymous checkouts you will need to login first. Oscar API comes with a simple login view for this:

.. code-block:: python

    data = {
        "username": "test",
        "password": "test"
    }
    response = session.post('http://localhost:8000/api/login/', json=data)

When the authentication was succesful, your will receive a new (authenticated) sessionid, and the anonymous basket has been automatically merged with a (previous stored) basket of this specific user. You can see now that the owner is set in the basket:

.. code-block:: python

    response = session.get('http://localhost:8000/api/basket/')
    print(response.content)
    {
        "currency": "EUR",
        "id": 2,
        "is_tax_known": true,
        "lines": "http://localhost:8000/api/baskets/2/lines/",
        "offer_discounts": [],
        # now, this basket has an owner
        "owner": "http://localhost:8000/api/users/2/",
        "status": "Open",
        "total_excl_tax": "10.00",
        "total_excl_tax_excl_discounts": "10.00",
        "total_incl_tax": "10.00",
        "total_incl_tax_excl_discounts": "10.00",
        "total_tax": "0.00",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/api/baskets/2/",
        "voucher_discounts": []
    }
