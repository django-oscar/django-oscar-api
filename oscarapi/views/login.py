    Api for logging in users.

    no way to reach it anymore

    POST(username, password):
    1. The user will be authenticated. The next steps will only be
       performed is login is successful. Logging in logged in users results in
       405.
    2. The anonymous cart will be merged with the private cart associated with
       that authenticated user.
    3. A new session will be started, this session identifies the authenticated
       user for the duration of the session, without further need for
       authentication.
    4. The new, merged cart will be associated with this session.
    5. The anonymous session will be terminated.
    6. A response will be issued containing the new session id as a header
       (only when the request contained the session header as well).

    GET (enabled in DEBUG mode only):
    Get the details of the logged in user.

    the fields the ``UserSerializer`` will render.
